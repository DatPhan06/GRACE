ERROR:root:Attempt 1 failed: Invalid json output: Okay, I understand the task. I need to re-rank the movie candidate list based on the seeker's preference for action movies and dislike for movies like Jaws. Then, I need to return the top 50 movies from the re-ranked list, formatted as a JSON object with a single field "movie_list" containing an array of movie titles.

Here's my plan:

1.  **Filter for Action Movies:** I will iterate through the candidate list and identify movies that are likely to be action movies. I'll use keywords like "action", "war", "mission", "raid", "hunt", "kill", "escape", "soldier", "sniper", "bourne", "terminator", "predator", "commando", "under siege", "avenger", "furious", "die
