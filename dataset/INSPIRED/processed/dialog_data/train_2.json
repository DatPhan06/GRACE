            "RECOMMENDER: <credibility> No, definitely not. <credibility> There's very little of that. <credibility> Like, you see some guy get beat up a bit for one scene, but for the most part it's all about the story and dialogue. <personal_opinion> It's a great movie.",

Just went to a midnight showing of The Room, and got to meet Tommy Wiseau!!  If you love those types of movies, that is definitely one of the best.  I did see Midsommar!  It was sooooooo interesting.  Very twisty, very weird, right up my odd alley.  LOL.  [movie_name] just jumped to the top of my list today!!",
            "RECOMMENDER: <acknowledgment> That's awesome! <credibility> The first one is very 70's old horror flick. <personal_experience> I watched it as a teenager, and still remember how so-bad-but-funny it was even ten years later. <no_strategy> I'm so glad we could find a good one for you to add to the list!",

            "SEEKER:  I haven't!!  I think I remember seeing commercials for it, or maybe it was an article online.  I think Ive learned I cant trust ratings.  That is going on my list to watch tonight too!  Im curious to see what you mean about the werewolves.  That's something that is always such a hit or miss for me.  I do love the werewolves in What We Do In The Shadows though!  Two great recommendations!!  Awesome!!  Thanks so much!",
            "RECOMMENDER: <personal_opinion> It's definitely a little cheesy, but for the time of release on the movie, I feel like the werewolf CGI was pretty well done. <experience_inquiry> And, I gotta throw this one out there for you as well, have you seen Queen of the Damned? <personal_opinion> Those vampires are something else for sure!",
