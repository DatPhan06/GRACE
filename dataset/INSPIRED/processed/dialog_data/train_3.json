            "B: It would be a like atleast 1.5-2 hour max and a kids movie rated g",

            "A: I'm going to start broadly--what kind of movies you like?",
            "B: I usually like documentary films, or at least historically accurate drama films!",
            "A: Interesting, not very many people that I know like those sort of films, but I do.",
            "B: That's great, I love documentaries! It's fun to learn and be entertained at the same time. What's your favorite?",
            "A: Well, even though I'm young in age, I do think older documentaries are still the best that has been done. Even though I would not classify this documentary as fun in a joyful manner, it is informative about a serious topic, the  Holocuast. The documentary is called [MOVIE_ID]",
            "B: That sounds very difficult to watch but interesting. Is it about a specific person who Jungle Holocaust (1977) or a more general documentary",
            "A: A general documentary about how the whole process of genocide against European Jews was carried. The unique thing about it is that it does not rely on a single piece of film from the 1930s or 1940s. The director, a French man travels to different parts of Europe, including the sites where the concentration camps once stood, and interviews the QUOTATION_MARKbystandersQUOTATION_MARK that saw their neighbors being removed. He also includes the input of prominent historians.",
            "B: That sounds really interesting! One would have to be in the right frame of mind to watch it I imagine, but the interviews sound fascinating and disturbing. Thanks for the info, I accept your recommendation!",
            "A: Although I forgot to mention a very important fact about the documentary that deters people from watching, It has to be seen on different sittings because it runs close to 9.5 hours, which I think reflects the seriousness of the subject is addressing.",
            "B: That doesn't sound bad, I just watched the Ken Burns PBS documentary, which is 10+ hours I believe. I really enjoyed it. Have you watched any of his documentaries?",
            "A: No, not really and the reason being that I read what some historians had to say about his Civil War documentary and it did not sound encouraging for my taste.",
            "B: That's too bad. I really enjoyed his Vietnam documentary because he did a good job of interviewing all sides and not just Americans. But his Civil War documentary was more focused on telling interesting anecdotes than the history it seemed like.",
            "A: Well, I think my fits perfectly your movie preferences. It is subtitled, obviously, but as a film buff I do check lists that come out in which critics rank their favorite movies and [MOVIE_ID] consistently ranks as one of the best, if not the best, documentary of all time.",
            "B: I'm not much of a film buff, but always happy to check out some films from before my time that I may have overlooked! Another good one that the critics also seem to like is \"[MOVIE_ID],\" have you seen that?",
            "A: Unfortunately no, I had not even heard of it. As you mentioned liking historically accurate, I do enjoy those as well. Although they might not be presented from the viewpoint of an important figure, they usually revolve around a important event like The Biggest Short with Ryan Gosling, Steve Carrell and Christian Bale. It presents a point of view about what led to the 2008 economic crash.",
            "B: I did enjoy the Biggest Short. I enjoy Revolutionary War ere history but haven't found any great documentaries on that yet. John Adams miniseries on HBO was pretty good for a drama though.",
            "A: How about earlier movies about earlier periods like the 1500s?",
            "B: I'm not very familiar with that time period unfortunately. I know a little bit about some of the explorers but that's about it. Any recommendations?",
            "A: Well, this is a movie not a documentary. But I consider it one of my favorite movies of all time. It's called [MOVIE_ID] It came out in 1972 and the reason why I like is because, even though it's not based on a specific, single reliable event, it's based on the idea among some Spanish conquistadores that there was hidden city made of gold ([MOVIE_ID]) in the [MOVIE_ID]. I really appreciate the German director attempt to recreate that period."

It made me think about the character in a different way.",
            "B: That is a new take, I think your right seeing him as a loner. I enjoed the Wolverine movies he is certainly a loner. Very character driven I enjoyed watching his emotions as he delt with taking carte of X-23 in the last film. I will give Spiderman Far From home a watch, thank you for the sugestion.",
            "A: You're right, those two characters have a lot of similarities story-wise, even though their personalities are so different. Sure thing! And if you have not seen the first one yet, Spider-Man Homecoming, make sure to give that a watch first!",

            "B: Oh, good. Thank makes sense. I can never keep track with all the reboots and things in movies some time.",
            "A: That makes sense, Spiderman has been redone so many times! There is even a new animated movie called Spider-man: Into the Spiderverse that subverts the traditional story by skipping most of it. It would be a fun option to pair with the Tom Holland versions for comparison.",
            "B: Ok, I think I have heard of that too. Spider Gwen is in it. I will check that out too!",
            "A: Yes, she is! There are several versions of Spider-man from comics over the years. The whole movie is a beautiful callback to the comics. Well, I hope you enjoy the Spider-man movies, and hopefully the Tom Holland will add to your enjoyment of the [MOVIE_ID]s movies, too.",

Not into seeing others in pain nor want to see blood spattered which is why I have not been watching more of the true crime documentary's recently. How about you, do you like horror and gory movies?",

Or, the original 80's IT is pretty good as well. It's quite a long one, but it is a good story. It's also not quite as scary as many of the other horror movies. Would you be interested in either of these?",
            "B: They sound interesting and totally worth the look. What other kinds of movies are you interested in? I'm a 56 yr old man so I can get into some of the older movies. Especially comedies! Have any favorites?",
            "A: I don't watch comedy as much as horror movies, but my favorite would probably [MOVIE_ID] It's a musical but all the songs are amazing. I remember when I was a kid I watched it with my mom, and we still quote it every day several years later! On top of that, its a great commentary on censorship, commentary that still holds up 20 years later. Would you be interested in that?",
            "B: I love South Park (1997) and another slam dunk! Its fun to watch someones commentaries on current events with a little comedy in its thread. I did like the Mel Brooks movies in the day. I remember my Father and I laughing till it hurt watching those movies. So is there a movie that you like which is a blend between horror and comedy?",
            "A: I guess the old 80's IT would be an example of that. It was never intended to be a comedy. But watching it today, you're sure to get a good laugh at Pennywise!",
            "B: I understand what you mean. I look at the old James Bond movies and laugh on how fake the fight scense look. Is there a fight scene you like in a particular movie?",

I think he could've built the world a little better but I thought Lupita's performance was absolutely terrifying, she really made the movie for me.",

It plays off the narrative of the first one and has some very interesting romances/flings/secret relationships... Plus it has some heart warming comedy. Do you like any other movie types?",

            "B: No I haven't, the last Spiderman I watched were the ones with Toby McGuire.",
            "A: I watched the ones with Toby McGuire when I was younger, and those are amazing too. But I actually really love what they have done with the new version of Spiderman. In Spiderman [MOVIE_ID], Peter [MOVIE_ID] is kind of like a geeky, weak high-school student who doesn't have a lot going for him until he becomes Spiderman! It's a refreshing twist on Spiderman in my opinion; it's a retelling, not a replacement for Toby McGuire's famous Spiderman!",
            "B: Perhaps I should watch the newer ones. Right now I'm wondering why Spiderman wasn't included in the avengers, wasn't he also a Stan Lee creation?",
            "A: He was-- Spiderman actually shows up in the third [MOVIE_ID] Movie, [MOVIE_ID] I think he was an addition that they hadn't thought of before, so they introduced him first in [MOVIE_ID]: Civil before he was actually in Spiderman: Homecoming. But yes, he is introduced in the third Avengers (2012) movie and then he is in all of the subsequent [MOVIE_ID]'s movies!",
            "B: I plan to watch the rest of the avengers movies, it'll be interesting to see how Spiderman affects the movie. I also watched [MOVIE_ID] the other day, I enjoyed the performance by Brie Larson, and Samuel [MOVIE_ID] is always good.",
            "A: Then I think my final recomendation will actually be [MOVIE_ID] I know you like sci-fi and the Avengers (2012) so I feel like this is logically the next best movie for you to watch! Spiderman isn't in this movie, but he appears in the next one; however, you have to watch the Avengers (2012) movies in order to understand what's going on in them. So what do you think?",

            "A: I did! Doesn't Avengers (2012)e Johanson star as Avengers (2012) I don't know a lot about her storyline, but she is definitely amazing in her role as Avengers (2012) She appears in the subsequent [MOVIE_ID]'s movies as well, so you should enjoy her in those.",

            "B: I'm trying to think of what else she has appeared in, all I can think of is Avengers (2012)",
            "A: I just saw Avengers (2012) in theaters and she stars as the mother of Jojo. The story takes place in Nazi Germany during World Avengers (2012) and she is great in her role as the mother of the boy. If you ever have time, Avengers (2012) is still in theaters and it's a must see!",
            "B: I haven't heard of Avengers (2012), is a drama War movie?",
            "A: Yeah, it's a comedy movie about a little boy in Nazi Germany who has Avengers (2012) as an imaginary friend. After he finds out that his mom is hiding a Jewish girl in their house, he slowly changes his ideologies to fit less with Hitler's. It's a great movie and I'd highly recommend. But yes, it was great talking with you! I hope that you have a great time watching the next [MOVIE_ID]'s movies, but firstly, [MOVIE_ID]",

The supporting characters are great as well, and [MOVIE_ID] Durant's role is not just a cameo, he is integral part of the story. Definitely recommend it.",

It kind of made me nervous/anxious at times because some scenes are chaotic, but that is part of the narrative. I saw it with my family, husband and two early-twenties boys and we all really like it.",

            "A: No, definitely not. There's very little of that. Like, you see some guy get beat up a bit for one scene, but for the most part it's all about the story and dialogue. It's a great movie.",

            "B: Is it more sci-fi? Or detective?",
            "A: So maybe a little more sci-fi, but not too much. The setting of the movie is after some disease has unfortunately wiped out most of the population. There is no real form of government, so people are looking after themselves and looking out for potential threats (mostly from other people trying to survive). But it's really more so from the perspective of this very shielded/protected teenager",

I remember watching this with my partner and it really was enjoyable for the two of us. In addition, Noah Centineo is an upcoming actor himself. I've been seeing him in a couple of shows and movies after watching this one!",

It's almost a given that it will be another great movie to watch as Zac Efron steals hearts and Adam Devine has a huge comedian side to him. [MOVIE_ID] cute and to watch!",

            "A: Right? I agree as well, he actually is a versatile actor. I know Zac Efron is a great actor in most of the romantic comedies he's in. But he also shows multiple sides to him in some of his action and suspenseful movies. I think Zac Efron is underrated for the wrong reasons.",

            "B: I'll check that one out, too. Thanks again!",
            "A: No problem. I'm a huge movie person. I like almost all genres except gruesome horror like the Saw films or Texas Chainsaw (2013) I can't handle those. I like thriller more just because it keeps you thinking. Since you like suspense i also recommend watching [MOVIE_ID].",
            "B: I just watched [MOVIE_ID] recently! I like James McAvoy I really like that trilogy of films with [MOVIE_ID] and [MOVIE_ID]. I don't really like any of the Saw films or Texas Chainsaw films, either. I'm more of a fan of psychological thrillers.",
            "A: That trilogy was really good. i think it took the director 10 plus years to make the sequel for [MOVIE_ID]. Honestly, I'm glad [MOVIE_ID] came out later because the technology they had back in the day did not do movies justice compared to now.",
            "B: That's so true. I think it there are so many movies that could have benefited from the graphics technology these days. But sometimes, I think movies like [MOVIE_ID] rely too much on the graphics and don't put enough emphasis on the story and character development and interaction. I wasn't 100% satisfied with the latest Star Wars trilogy, and that's sad because I'm a huge Star Wars fan.",
            "A: YES!! To be honest though, I like more and more movies coming out don't have enough originality. So movie company rather throw in an explosion or two just to make the more captivating.",
            "B: I totally agree. I really appreciate action movies that have a great plot and character development.",
            "A: Sorry for my lack of words the last comment. I reread what I typed and it made no sense. Yes, action movies are great but almost all the actions movies that are released are comic book based or unoriginal. I have yet to see a movie that's  not based on a book or a documentary of some kind.",
            "B: That's true. Maybe because they're the easiest to merchandise. I feel like that's a big consideration of production companies these days. One original action movie that I saw recently was another Korean film called [MOVIE_ID] There's a great sub-genre of Korean action films that just focus on revenge. Do you know any other films like that?",
            "A: No, I don't know any films like that. I usually don't watch foreign films, mostly because of the subtitles. Although, all the films you've been recommending seem super interesting.",

If he doesn't send the message to his brother all of the soldiers with his brother will die. It was very historical and interesting. [MOVIE_ID] is a unique super hero movie and really interesting.",

If it is unique, I would be interested in watching it to see what makes it different. Thank you for the recommendation and I accept it.",
            "A: Yes. You should watch the [MOVIE_ID] trailer. I don't really like super hero movies either, but it was unique because the character isn't a traditional super hero like we see in Spiderman. The movie also had social and historical elements, and is based on Africa. It is really unique and insightful. It isn't like a [MOVIE_ID] movie haha. That's why i'd recommend it.",

            "B: Wow that actually sounds like a great movie! I'm an engineer myself so I feel like I would connect with Matt. I also dearly loved Robin Williams, so it will be nice to see him acting. Yes, would definitely be interested in watching the trailer.",

            "B: I used to rent them from a REDBOX which is outside of 7/11's and you can rent them for like $1, but I just pay a little bit more and rent them on my smart tv which is more convenient.",

            "A: 30 days of night is definitely a good one. What are some other horror movies you've enjoyed recently?",
            "B: I saw [MOVIE_ID] just the other day. It was surprisingly good, even though the reviews have said otherwise. I actually run a horror movie podcast for international horror movies. Just recently we spoke about [MOVIE_ID] a horror movie on Netflix. Amazing movie. I wanted to go see [MOVIE_ID] but I'm worried it is going to be a waste of money. I also saw [MOVIE_ID] (the one that came out this year). It was so bad it was funny. lol",
            "A: Haha I can certainly see finding good humor in The Grudge. If you like \"so terrible its types of films, [MOVIE_ID] was definitely one of my favorites. Definitely over the top, and the special effects were just absolutely icing on the cake. It's a great one if you're into the older films as well. Another I can recommend that was a bit more on the serious side... have you seen Midsommer?",
            "B: I have heard of [MOVIE_ID] but haven't seen, it, but it is on the list. Love the QUOTATION_MARKso terrible its funnyQUOTATION_MARK type! Just went to a midnight showing of The Room, and got to meet Tommy Wiseau!! If you love those types of movies, that is definitely one of the best. I did see [MOVIE_ID] It was sooooooo interesting. Very twisty, very weird, right up my odd alley. LOL. [MOVIE_ID] just jumped to the top of my list today!!",
            "A: That's awesome! The first one is very 70's old horror flick. I watched it as a teenager, and still remember how so-bad-but-funny it was even ten years later. I'm so glad we could find a good one for you to add to the list!",

            "B: I'm definitely interested in a few more horro-esque recommendations! Im always up for expanding the list. I'm going to a horror film fest in June, and I want to expand my library quickly:-)",
            "A: Have you ever seen [MOVIE_ID]? Christina Ricci, werewolf movie! Not too great ratings, but I love how they did the werewolves in that. I wish they'd have used similar styles to translate to other popular films!",
            "B: I haven't!! I think I remember seeing commercials for it, or maybe it was an article online. I think Ive learned I cant trust ratings. That is going on my list to watch tonight too! Im curious to see what you mean about the werewolves. That's something that is always such a hit or miss for me. I do love the werewolves in What We Do In The Shadows though! [MOVIE_ID] Awesome!! Thanks so much!",
            "A: It's definitely a little cheesy, but for the time of release on the movie, I feel like [MOVIE_ID] was pretty well done. And, I gotta throw this one out there for you as well, have you seen [MOVIE_ID]? Those vampires are something else for sure!",
            "B: I have!! Its one of my favorites:-) I see we have very similar tastes. Any other vampire ones you like?",
            "A: I will say, I was a fan of [MOVIE_P_DIRECTOR_2]: [MOVIE_ID] as well. I didn't think I'd like it as I am, honestly, very reserved about gore in horror films and am not a fan. But I found that one to be absolutely tasteful, not overly done at all for what they had in it! May I also recommend more of a suspense film that is a little more on the side of ghosts and hauntings than vampires?",
            "B: Interesting. Another one I haven't seen that piques my curiosity. Yes please, what is the suspense film that you think I would like?",
            "A: Ah! Excellent. You'll be well prepared for your podcast up and coming ;) I also highly recommend [MOVIE_ID]. Halle Berry plays the main role, and the twist at the end is just absolutely stunning if you ask me. Definitely one of my personal favorites!",
            "B: Oh interesting. Halle Berry in a suspense film that has to do with ghosts??!! Sign me up! It was awesome talking to you! Thank you so much! I will be very well prepared:)",

I don't want to spoil it and I know it sounds cheesy but it's actually really sweet and super funny and not at all what you would probably expect out of a teen pregnancy movie.",

            "A: Cool, one of my favorites this year was [MOVIE_ID] with Jennifer Aniston Adam Sandler. The formula is the stale couple rekindling their romance but it takes place on a yacht and a murder takes place and they find themselves in the middle of trying to solve it while working out their relationship issues.",

            "A: I did just watch a horror movie called [MOVIE_ID] with some friends about a month ago, that one was super odd. You heard of it?",
            "B: i have, and i've seen it too! i agree, it was one of the strangest films i've seen in a long time. i appreciate the cinematography though. since i've seen it already, do you have any other recommendations?",
            "A: Yeah that was a real weird experience with friends haha. Anyways, other ones I liked recently were [MOVIE_ID] (though most people have seen that haha), One [MOVIE_ID] but that was great), No country for Old Men (Engaging to watch, interesting villain, and cinematography was good), and There will be [MOVIE_ID] (super weird and quite good)",
            "B: ohh, you know what, i haven't seen [MOVIE_ID] yet but i've really been wanting to! i've heard a lot of great reviews, and didn't it win some awards recently? [MOVIE_ID] is one i've been meaning to watch as well, thank you for the reminder, haha!",
            "A: Oh nice! Yeah, I was late to the [MOVIE_ID] but it's fascinating movie. I know that a lot of hype can bring people into movies with inflated expectations but I went in knowing as little as possible and it really was great. Awesome atmosphere and great acting.",
            "B: i try not to let the hype affect my expectations too much, but sometimes i can't help but hold a movie to a higher standard after a certain point. well, thank you for the suggestions, i'll definitely watch those when i get a chance!",
            "A: Nice :). Since you pointed out the cinemetography in midsommar (and watched it in the first place) I imagine you're the kind of person who'll appreciate both of them for that alone, not to mention the other good aspects",
            "B: oh yes, good cinematography combined with good acting are huge selling points for me when it comes to watching (and liking) a movie.",
            "A: Well they both have unusually great acting so that'll definitely be a plus for you. Joker's massively pushed forward by [MOVIE_ID]'s great acting.",

            "A: I'm not sure I've actually seen anything else he was in that I recognized at least haha. But I was thinking of looking up some other ones to see after this movie, though I got distracted and never followed through with that. Maybe now I'll remember :P",
            "B: oh, really? [MOVIE_ID] is a great place to start.:)",

Like [MOVIE_ID] is giant monsters fighting, acting doesn't really matter there, or something like Hateful Eight is a half dozen people sitting in a room and talking for 3 hours, yet it was thrilling.",

The whole Grudge/Ring crazy and now Annabelle/conjuring craze just doesn't interest me. It's all ghosts haunting houses. I like more creative ones like [MOVIE_ID], or [MOVIE_ID]. [MOVIE_ID] and [MOVIE_ID] were both fantastic.",

The movie is shown in a very unique way where it goes back and forth between present time and flashbacks as the man comes back to remembering these times. My description doesn't make it sound very interesting but I really enjoyed the movie.

Another great movie to see right now is A beautiful day in the neighborhood- The Mr Rogers movie. Its nostalgic and I feel the best move of the year. Tom Hanks did an excellent job.",

I know I enjoy many action, thrillers, horror, comedy, drama, and suspense types. I am quite curious about maybe seeing a trailer for a favorite movie of yours in the victorian style as that would be new to me.",
            "A: Most of the victorian style movies have been developed from a writer of that era and have been made more than once. They tend to remake them between 10 and 20 years apart. The newest one to fall under this category would be EMMA. Gwyneth Paltrow played Emma in the last one. They are of English/England culture in nature between early and late 1800s.",
            "B: Oh I see, that sounds quite interesting I will search a trailer for that! Thank you for the suggestion.",
            "A: My pleasure. Oscar Wilde is a great writer of that era. Jane Eyre and [MOVIE_ID] are also of that nature. Social issues and proper etiquette rule the show. The humor can be found in the expectation of proper etiquette yet, the rude manner it can be delivered. A great place to learn proper ways of socializing.",
            "B: I just watched a small trailer for the movie [MOVIE_ID] that you suggested, I can indeed see many of the elements you mentioned being in the movie. It looks like it would be a wonderful watch with a close friend of mine, i think we will put this on our to do list! I know we both would quite enjoy the humor in this show just from the brief trailer I saw.",

            "B: I just watched a trailer for QUOTATION_MARKAn Ideal HusbandQUOTATION_MARK this looks like another good suggestion, also QUOTATION_MARKThe importance of being ErnestQUOTATION_MARK sounds very familiar, I know I have heard of that before, thank you for that suggestion too.",
            "A: You are welcome",
            "B: An Ideal Husband is from 1999, and has many familiar faces of actors I have seen in other films over the years. I am shocked I don't recall watching it, but it also seems a good watch with my friend I mentioned previously. I tend to do movie nights often with a close friend, and we are always looking for new things to watch, I know she would like these.",
            "A: Yes...I agree. The play on our social scenes versus early England society is wonderful. We are still the same except they hid their misdoings while we are more relaxed about shortcomings.",

            "B: That sounds quite interesting too, I will do some research on that now. That was another movie type I forgot to mention liking, autobiography I guess it would be called? telling the story of someones life works and such",
            "A: Yes...Oscar Wilde is an interesting character to learn about. Don't forget to have tea and pastries for your movie night. A good idea with a Victorian themed movie date. HAVE A WONDERFUL NIGHT....good night",

I was re-watching the movie for the one millionth time last year and during my re-watch, when Candyman was being summoned, the power went out in my house. Talk about jump scare! I thought he was coming to my home. :D I think anyone who hasn't seen this movie, should definitely give it a try. It's got a great story, great actors and is plenty creepy.",

            "B: Is he the character Anthony McCoy being played by Yahya Abdul-Mateen II in 2020?",
            "A: Somewhat, yes. Anthony McCoy is going to be a hallucinatory reflection of the Candyman. We will still hear Tony Todd's voice I believe and may even see him a few times in the 2020 film. Quite interesting. I have high hopes for the remake that's coming out later this year, but since we may not see Tony Todd much in the movie, I strongly recommend for you to see 1992 film.",

One personality in particular [MOVIE_ID] Beast - has a plan Some of the personalities side with The Beast, and some do not. It is the second film in [MOVIE_ID] series, but different in style for sure. You don't need to know anything about Unbreakable to see Split, though.",

            "B: A similar story is fine - But I'd prefer a more traditional film that isn't nearly 100% silent. But something with dread!",

The gore is there, lighter but extreme when it does happen. I would suggest you try looking up The Transfiguration. It's a drama/horror flick and I found it to be moving.",

            "A: The Transfiguration is about a seemingly normal boy who believes he is a vampire. He is dark and withdrawn, and believes he is a monster. You get to follow him through a snapshot of his story, and all of it is very dark.",
            "B: That actually sounds like an intriguing and unique premise. Plus a fresh take on Vampire Killers (2009) Is it a newer film (like within the last 15 years)? Or older?",
            "A: It came out in 2016 in the Cannes Film Festival from an Australian director. Haha, I had a Shudder account for a brief time and found it there while I was movie binging.",
            "B: Was it well received at Cannes? I know just being accepted there tells me it should be a great movie!",
            "A: It was well received and nominated for a few prizes but won nothing at Cannes. It did however win the General Jury prize at Dublin International in 2017.",
            "B: Honestly though, just being nominated is an accomplishment in itself. Do you know the Rotten Tomatoes score?",
            "A: It's got 85% on Rotten Tomatoes! Only a 6/10 on IMDB but I think they were being a little hard on it for being an Indie film. It's almost slow moving in its thoughtfulness, but really pulled me in with its unique take on the theory of vampirism.",
            "B: 85 is a great score considering how harsh Rotten Tomatoes can be. But the fact that you said it's slow moving in its thoughtfulness really piques my interest as I can't stand fast paced horror films plagued with jump scares. Does anyone famous star in it?",
            "A: No, it's a film full of fresh meat! I actually sort of prefer horror movies this way, because you can go into it almost blind and you can really evaluate the talent or passion of the actors involved. I also love lesser known directors as I feel like they're willing to take shots other more well known directors might not take or just plain overdo. Do you look for more famous actors when you look for horror films?",

And honestly, I don't as I feel having someone you don't know makes it easier to relate where as with someone famous, it's a distraction because you already QUOTATION_MARKkmow themQUOTATION_MARK. I think I may just accept your recommendation and check it out! Is there anything else I should know about it beforehand?",

It's quite a brain twister.",

Romero described that the whole consumerism thing was his inspiration, where the mall shoppers are like zombies. A classic, and when you think about it, you can see that in the film.",
